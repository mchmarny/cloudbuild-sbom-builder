In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.","cvss":[{"version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.2,"exploitabilityScore":2,"impactScore":2.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go"},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.3.9 (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"(devel)","type":"go-module","locations":[],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:(devel):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@(devel)","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf"],"description":"containerd CRI plugin: Host memory exhaustion through ExecSync","cvss":[],"fix":{"versions":["1.5.13"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[]},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-31030","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31030","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/1","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/c1bcabb4541930f643aa36a2b38655e131346382","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5162","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/REOZCUAPCA7NFDWYBDYX6EYXWLHABKBO/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WSIGDBHAB3I75JBJNGWEPBTJPS2FOVHD/"],"description":"containerd is an open source container runtime.

If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it.

Prior to version 1.5.2, Cosign can be manipulated to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and \"keyless signing\" with Fulcio. If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of Cosign. The `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail.

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.8,"impactScore":6.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go"},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.3 (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"(devel)","type":"go-module","locations":[],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:(devel):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@(devel)","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296"],"description":"cosign's `cosign verify-attestaton  --type` can report a false positive if any attestation exists","cvss":[],"fix":{"versions":["1.10.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[]},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-35929","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35929","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/c5fda01a8ff33ca981f45a9f13e7fb6bd2080b94","https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296"],"description":"cosign is a container signing and verification utility.
